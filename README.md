# Duolingo System
An application that helps in learning +35 languages through quick, bite-sized lessons. Practice speaking, reading, listening and writing to build your vocabulary and grammar skills. User can register if he /she doesnâ€™t have an account or log in if he /she has already account. The application gives the student the ability to have the normal application, or he/she can have the premium for advanced features. Also gives the opportunity to each student to choose whether he will be enrolled in a classroom with a specific teacher or practice the language that he has chosen with himself in the form of questions and answers. In both cases, the Teacher is the one who is responsible for Making the content of the Language and Generating the report of each student based on the student's attendance, practices, and test grades. Each student has the ability to choose his/her level or take a test to see which level is suitable for him /her. Also takes a test to check his/her practice on every skill he /she takes. He /she has the ability to take competition (optional) according to the score that he/she takes at every level. The teachers and students give their feedback about anything in the system to improve it and make it flexible in use.
